## joninja sample API with laravel
**I cloned joninja.ir API just to learn and grow in Laravel.**

My goal is to be able to create a personal resume building site that works with username path. For example, for me, it's like this: example.com/dana, so I can access the user's resume and work history,etc.

## updates
-[ ]  convert to laravel 11
- [ ] service/dependency arch
- [ ] remove custom header auth (low security)
- [ ] use laravel Octane.
- [ ] add frontend with react and run service on real web site.
